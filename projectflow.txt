1. Create git repo and clone it
2. create code.py , This script creates a small dataset, optionally adds rows (currently commented), and saves it as a CSV in a data directory.
3. git add commit push and commit
4. pip install dvc
5. dvc init creates .dvc folder and a .dvcignore. (tip: compare to git)
6. mkdir s3 (lets assume,u create a bucket in s3)
7. now we tell dvc where our remote data is "dvc remote add -d myremote S3" (just add url instead of S3)
8. dvc add data - this tells that it will track this folder for any changes.Also it creates a data.dvc file with ID to track with the github.
9. dvc commit and then dvc push
10. Edit the mycode.py to add a new member.
11. Do dvc commit u will see the data.dvc id changed but when u do dvc push then new file will be addded in S3.
